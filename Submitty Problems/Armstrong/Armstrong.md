# Implement a function in C++ to check whether number is Armstrong or not.
* A positive integer is called an Armstrong number (of order n) if
* abcd... = a^n + b^n + c^n + d^n + ...

# Sample input:
3
123 100 307

# Explaination:
    * First line is the number of inputs.
    * Next line is the integers which must be checked seperated by space
    
# Sample output:
NO
NO
NO


# Explaination:
    * 123 is not a Armstrong number because 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 is not equal to 123
    * 100 is not a Armstrong number because 1^3 + 0^3 + 0^3 is not equal to 100
    * 307 is not a Armstrong number because 3^3 + 0^3 + 7^3 is not equal to 307

# Submitty Evaluation
* Implement your code in a file named "armstrong.cpp" and upload to the Armstrong gradable.
* Mismatch in the name of file will cause opilation error and no sore will be given.
* First 3 submissions can get full score and from 4th subission onwards 50% of the total score will be deducted.
* Test your code locally before uploading.
